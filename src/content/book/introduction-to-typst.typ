This is a sample book chapter written in Typst format.

== What is Typst?

Typst is a new markup-based typesetting system that is designed to be as powerful as LaTeX while being easier to learn and use.

=== Key Features

- *Fast compilation*: Typst compiles documents much faster than LaTeX
- *Clean syntax*: Easy to read and write markup
- *Modern features*: Built-in support for modern typography
- *Scripting*: Powerful scripting capabilities

== Getting Started

To get started with Typst, you need to understand the basic syntax:

```typ
= Heading Level 1
== Heading Level 2
=== Heading Level 3

*Bold text* and _italic text_

- Bullet point 1
- Bullet point 2
- Bullet point 3

1. Numbered item 1
2. Numbered item 2
3. Numbered item 3
```

== Mathematical Expressions

Typst has excellent support for mathematical notation:

$ integral_0^infinity e^(-x^2) dif x = sqrt(pi)/2 $

And inline math like $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.

== Code Examples

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```
