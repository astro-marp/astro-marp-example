For a long time, I am willing to setup a personal site to host my learning, reading and thoughts, but due to the operation overhead, I can't do this properly, perviously I tried to host it on my vps, but because of misconfiguration, the site is hacked and I lost all the data. I just pause the proposal, and continuously to find a better way that will not cost me too much time and energy.


Several months ago, I know astro, but it feels like a little complex; but today I try it again, and with ease I setup my blog and also host it in github pages, this save me a lot of effort.


I also enabled latex support,, so I can write the various equations in my blog; also mermaid is also added, with it I can draw some charts.


lets move on !!!


## add latex support

- modify `astro.config.mjs`
  - import two packages
    ```astro
    import remarkMath from "remark-math";
    import rehypeKatex from "rehype-katex";
    ```
  - in function `defineConfig`, add the plugins

    ```js
    export default defineConfig({
      site: "https://blog.lmyby.icu",
      markdown: {
        // Applied to .md and .mdx files
        remarkPlugins: [remarkMath], // relevant
        rehypePlugins: [rehypeKatex], // relevant
      },
      integrations: [
        mdx({
          remarkPlugins: [remarkMath], // relevant
          rehypePlugins: [rehypeKatex], // relevant
        }),
        sitemap(),
        tailwind(),
      ],
    });
    ```
- modify `src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro`, in the `<head>`, add `katex` related `css` and `js`, so the `<head>` tag will look like this:
  ```astro
  <head>
    <BaseHead title={title} description={description} image={image} , ogType={ogType} />
    {TRANSITION_API && <ViewTransitions />}
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.16.11/dist/katex.min.css" integrity="sha384-nB0miv6/jRmo5UMMR1wu3Gz6NLsoTkbqJg  hGIsx//Rlm+ZU03BU6SQNC66uf4l5+" crossorigin="anonymous">
      <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.16.11/dist/katex.min.js" integrity="sha384-7zkQWkzuo3B5mTepMUcHkMB5jZaolc2xDwL6VFqjFALcbeS9Ggm/Yr2r3Dy4lfFg" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
      <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.16.11/dist/contrib/auto-render.min.js" integrity="sha384-43gviWU0YVjaDtb/GhzOouOXtZMP/7XUzwPTstBeZFe/+rCMvRwr4yROQP43s0Xk" crossorigin="anonymous" onload="renderMathInElement(document.body);"></script>
  </head>
  ```
- install package
  ```bash
  npm install  remark-math rehype-katex
  ```
## add mermaid support

- modify `astro.config.mjs`
  - import two packages
    ```astro
    import expressiveCode from "astro-expressive-code";
    import remarkMermaid from 'remark-mermaidjs'
    ```
  - in function `defineConfig`, add the plugins and integrations, make sure `expressiveCode()` is the first integrations

    ```astro
    export default defineConfig({
      site: "https://blog.lmyby.icu",
      markdown: {
        // Applied to .md and .mdx files
        remarkPlugins: [remarkMath, remarkMermaid], // relevant
        rehypePlugins: [rehypeKatex], // relevant
      },
      integrations: [
        expressiveCode(),
        mdx({
          remarkPlugins: [remarkMath, remarkMermaid], // relevant
          rehypePlugins: [rehypeKatex], // relevant
        }),
        sitemap(),
        tailwind(),
      ],
    });
    ```
- install package
  ```bash
  npm install astro-expressive-code playwright remark-mermaidjs
  npm install --save-dev playwright
  ```
